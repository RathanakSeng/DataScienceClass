The water levels along the Mekong River in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia are set to drop due to decreased outflows at the Jinghong hydropower station in China's Yunnan province as China conducts maintenance on its power grid infrastructure from January 5 to 24.A statement from the inter-governmental Mekong River Commission (MRC) on January 6 announced that the maintenance would result in a reduced water flow of 1,000 cubic metres per second (m3/s) from January 5-24, citing information from China's Ministry of Water Resources.The flow rate will gradually return to normal from January 25, but the ministry did not specify river levels before the reduction or the volume to be restored, the statement said.The MRC observed that the outflow level at Jinghong began decreasing from 1,410m3/s on December 31 to 768m3/s on January 1, representing a nearly 50 per cent drop. The flow rate rose slightly to 786m3/s between January 1-4.
